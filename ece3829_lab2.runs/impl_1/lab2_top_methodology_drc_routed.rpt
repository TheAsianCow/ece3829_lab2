2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mmcm_inst/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u1/m0/temp_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u1/m0/temp_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u4/cnt_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u4/cnt_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u4/cnt_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u4/cnt_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u4/cs_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mmcm_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mmcm_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, u0/clk, mmcm_inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>
