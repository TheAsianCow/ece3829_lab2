TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mmcm_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mmcm_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
